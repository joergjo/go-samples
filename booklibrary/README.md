# booklibrary

This is a [Go](https://golang.org/) port of [Addy Osmani's Book Library sample for
Backbone.js and Node.js](https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/#exercise-2-book-library---your-first-restful-backbone.js-app).

> Note: Currently, this project only contains the Web API, but not the Backbone SPA or any other client application.
